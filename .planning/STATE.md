# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-06)

**Core value:** Phone motion feels physically immediate on screen — sub-20ms sensor delivery from phone to desktop, lowest possible latency.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — server-and-transport-foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 2 — Signaling, TURN, and Deployment
Plan: Not started
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-07-06 — Phase 01 complete, transitioned to Phase 2

Progress: [███████░░░] 67%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 19 min
- Total execution time: 0.6 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 01 | 2/3 | 37 min | 19 min |
| 01 | 3 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: P01 (2 min), P02 (35 min)
- Trend: —

*Updated after each plan completion*

| Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| Phase 01 P01 | 2 min | 3 tasks | 8 files |
| Phase 01 P02 | 35 min | 3 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 01 P03 | 1 | 3 tasks | 3 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Rust/wtransport for WebTransport server — zero GC pauses, only production-ready pure-Rust WebTransport impl
- Phase 1: mkcert for local dev TLS — Caddy cannot proxy WebTransport (issue #5421 unresolved)
- Phase 2: coturn must run with `network_mode: host` — bridge mode silently breaks STUN
- Phase 4: `{ ordered: false, maxRetransmits: 0 }` enforced from first data channel use — browser default is ordered/reliable
- Phase 4: iOS DeviceMotion permission must be in synchronous user gesture handler — gated behind button before any sensor code
- Phase 5: MessagePack (msgpackr) for binary encoding — 3x faster than JSON, ~40 bytes per packet target
- [Phase ?]: resolver=2 in workspace Cargo.toml for 2021 edition feature unification
- [Phase ?]: certs/ gitignored before any cert files exist — T-01-01 private key disclosure mitigation
- [Phase ?]: Cargo.lock committed to repo to pin exact crate versions — T-01-02 supply chain tampering mitigation
- [Phase ?]: #[allow(dead_code)] on echo.rs public items until Plans 02/03 activate them — avoids false warnings on stub modules
- Phase 1 Plan 02: NSS store install (libnss3-tools + mkcert -install) required for Chrome QUIC cert trust on Debian/Ubuntu — webtransport-developer-mode flag alone insufficient without CA in NSS store
- [Phase ?]: lib.rs added to expose ws_server to integration tests — integration tests link against lib crate not binary crate
- [Phase ?]: Test port 18080 for ws_echo integration test — avoids conflicts with running server on port 8080
- [Phase ?]: Phase 1: Plain ws:// only for WebSocket fallback — WSS with TLS deferred to Phase 2 Docker deployment per RESEARCH.md Open Q1

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 Plan 02 RESOLVED: WebTransport TLS cert requirements — Chrome echo round-trip verified; NSS store install required on Debian/Ubuntu
- Phase 2 critical: TURN credential endpoint must generate at connection-start (not page load) to prevent staleness
- Phase 5: Madgwick beta empirical tuning (0.1 default, ramp 0.2–0.3 at cold start) requires real-device validation
- Phase 5: ZUPT adaptive threshold values require empirical tuning — plan device testing session
