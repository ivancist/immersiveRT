# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-06)

**Core value:** Phone motion feels physically immediate on screen — sub-20ms sensor delivery from phone to desktop, lowest possible latency.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Server and Transport Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Server and Transport Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-07-06 — Roadmap created, 41 requirements mapped across 8 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Rust/wtransport for WebTransport server — zero GC pauses, only production-ready pure-Rust WebTransport impl
- Phase 1: mkcert for local dev TLS — Caddy cannot proxy WebTransport (issue #5421 unresolved)
- Phase 2: coturn must run with `network_mode: host` — bridge mode silently breaks STUN
- Phase 4: `{ ordered: false, maxRetransmits: 0 }` enforced from first data channel use — browser default is ordered/reliable
- Phase 4: iOS DeviceMotion permission must be in synchronous user gesture handler — gated behind button before any sensor code
- Phase 5: MessagePack (msgpackr) for binary encoding — 3x faster than JSON, ~40 bytes per packet target

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 critical: WebTransport TLS cert requirements are strict — use `chrome://flags/#webtransport-developer-mode` in dev, Let's Encrypt in prod
- Phase 2 critical: TURN credential endpoint must generate at connection-start (not page load) to prevent staleness
- Phase 5: Madgwick beta empirical tuning (0.1 default, ramp 0.2–0.3 at cold start) requires real-device validation
- Phase 5: ZUPT adaptive threshold values require empirical tuning — plan device testing session
