# Phase quick-260711-0lh Plan 01: Fix huge position drift in phone motion controller Summary

**Fixed rotateDeviceToWorld() to apply primaryQuat directly instead of its conjugate, eliminating orientation-dependent spurious acceleration that was injected into the Kalman position integrator on every phone tilt.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min
- **Started:** 2026-07-11T00:38:23+01:00 (plan commit)
- **Completed:** 2026-07-11T00:43:20+01:00
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Corrected the rotation direction in `rotateDeviceToWorld()` — device-frame acceleration is now rotated into world frame using `primaryQuat` directly (standard active quaternion rotation), matching the same device→world convention `scene.ts` already uses unconjugated to orient the rendered mesh
- Replaced the stale comment that incorrectly described `primaryQuat` as world→device
- Exported `rotateDeviceToWorld` in-place so it is independently unit-testable, with zero changes to its call site
- Added `client/tests/phone-rotate.test.ts`, locking the +90° yaw convention (device (1,0,0)→world (0,1,0), device (0,1,0)→world (-1,0,0)) and an identity-quaternion no-op case — this test would have failed against the old conjugate bug
- Ran the full client vitest suite (95 tests across 8 files) — zero regressions

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Fix rotation direction and comment in rotateDeviceToWorld, and export it** - `ba3e172` (fix)
2. **Task 2: Add unit test locking the device→world rotation convention** - `672c608` (test)
3. **Task 3: Run full client test suite to confirm no regressions** - verification only, no code changes (95/95 tests passed)

**Plan metadata:** commit pending (docs: complete plan — handled by orchestrator)

## Files Created/Modified
- `client/src/phone.ts` - Fixed `rotateDeviceToWorld()` to apply `primaryQuat` directly (not its conjugate); corrected the comment describing the quaternion convention; exported the function for testability
- `client/tests/phone-rotate.test.ts` - New unit test locking the device→world rotation convention using a known +90° yaw quaternion, plus an identity no-op case

## Decisions Made
- Applied the fix exactly as specified in the plan/context (root cause was pre-confirmed, not re-litigated): flip both cross products from reversed to standard operand order, deriving `t = 2·(q_vec × v)` and the additive `q_vec × t` term for the final result.
- Kept the fix scoped entirely inside `rotateDeviceToWorld()` and its comment — did not touch the call site, rotational/gyro ZUPT, the `POSITION_MAX` clamp, or `scene.ts` axis-mapping/negation logic, per explicit out-of-scope instructions.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- The acceleration-integration path now uses the correct device→world rotation; dead-reckoning position should track real phone motion instead of running away to the `POSITION_MAX` clamp.
- No physical-phone manual UAT was performed in this task — the user will verify drift-free position tracking on a real device as a follow-up (per CONTEXT.md decision). This is the one `human_judgment: true` coverage item above.
- Rotational ZUPT (gyro-based stillness detection) remains deferred/out of scope, as decided in CONTEXT.md — residual gyro-noise-driven drift, if any, is a separate future task.
